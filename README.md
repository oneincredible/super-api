# Super API

Super-Opinionated Framwork for Building a REST API.


## Summary

Super API is a hyper-opinionated framework for building REST APIs.

* ### Immutable RDBMS Storage

  All writes leave a perfect audit history. Data fields are never overwritten implicitly. 
  This is enforced to the degree that data tables only need `INSERT` grants.

* ### UUID enforced as id for objects.

  Abandoning serial ids avoids conflicts and optimizes opportunities for parallellism.
  
* ### Client side Id generation.
  
  Server side will never generate ids for objects. This avoids clients from needing two sets of ids 
  when handling state in memory and removes the need for colleting data back from the server as objects
  are created.

* ### CQRS Enforced
  
  Framework adheres to Command Query Responsibility Segregation. This means in practice that 
  `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT` never returns data and all data fetching using `GET` must be 
  performed explicitly by clients.
